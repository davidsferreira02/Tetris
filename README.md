**Gameplay**

The game consists in stacking the tetriminos that go down the screen in order to complete horizontal lines.

The tetriminos have different forms and go one after the other randomly, with a specific time gap.

The objective is to fill all the empty space in a line.

When a line forms, it vanishes from the screen, the upper layers fall and the player earned points.

Tetris' goal is just to try to fight the computerized tetrimino dropper to play for as long as possible while you're earning points.
